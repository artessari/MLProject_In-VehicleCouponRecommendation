# In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation - Machine Learning Project

This project explores the application of various machine learning models to predict whether a user will accept an in-vehicle coupon based on demographic, contextual, and coupon-specific factors. The project is based on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (retrievable from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/603/in+vehicle+coupon+recommendation) and focuses on classification techniques.

This project was developed as part of the **Machine Learning course** at the **Free University of Bolzano**.

## Project Overview

The objective is to classify whether a customer will accept a coupon based on features like user demographics, the destination, and the specifics of the coupon. The key stages of the project are:

- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Comparison of Model Performance
